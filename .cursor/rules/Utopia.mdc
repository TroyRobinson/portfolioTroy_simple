description: When dealing with architectural decisions regaring styling, node, packages, environment, Utopia, Vercel, or Local Setup.

# Background
- Our app runs both locally (our dev setup & Vercel entry point) via the top level index.html
- Our app also runs in the online Utopia react-as-the-source-of-truth IDE / design tools. Which has the entry point at public/index.html. 

Note that Utopia has a strange, outdated build process that may render some NPM packages un-usable in their default form. We can get around this sometimes by using ESM.SH

# Rule
Ensure that however we set up the app, it runs the same in both places.
