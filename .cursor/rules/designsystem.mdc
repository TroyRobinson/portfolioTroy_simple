# Styling elements or components
- Use inline style props e.g. style={{...}} for stying. No styles via other props, CSS in the top of the file, or CSS files (except for global below).

# Theme 
- Generally develop the theme of the app via component primatives (see below)
- Only use the global CSS file and variables for default font, brand accent color, and completely global styles.
- Size & spacing in 8px increments
