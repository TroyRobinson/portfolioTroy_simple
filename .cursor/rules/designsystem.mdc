# Styling elements or components
- Use inline style props e.g. style={{...}} for stying. No styles via other props, CSS in the top of the file, or CSS files (except for global below).
- Set line-height: 1.2 on text elements to control spacing (global reset in app.jsx handles defaults).
- Remember browser text elements have default spacing from both margins and line-height.

# Theme 
- Generally develop the theme of the app via component primatives (see below)
- Only use the global CSS file and variables for default font, brand accent color, and completely global styles.
- Size & spacing in 8px increments
